# Project Todo App

## Overview

This project aligns with CRUD functionalities, also shows how to model any possible relationship that we can have between models in a relational database and I learned all of the foundational bread and butter tools that is needed to use anytime I want to build out an application that does CRUD no matter what kind of relationships exist between their models. So essentially this is a full-stack web development project.

# The set of concepts I covered in this project include:

* Implementing update functionality: update a todo item's completed state.
* Implementing delete functionality: remove a todo item.
* Model relationships between objects in SQL and SQLAlchemy.
  * Setting up Foreign Key constraints.
* Building CRUD on Lists of To-Do items.
* One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
